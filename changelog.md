## Lore

You wake up as an SI student in the first week of classes and you have a crush on an e-girl classmate (Isa) that you met in the university's introduction week. She has 7 ex-boyfriends that are obsessed with her. You need to fight them to get closer to her.

You are entering EACH at the CPTM gate, the guard asks you for your cusp (USP card), so you have to play a minigame to give it to him.

You run to your class at Titanic and plays the Calculo 1 class minigame (if you lose the minigame Isa gets disapointed and if you win she starts to notice you)

Prompt: where do you want to go today:
- Grass
- gymnasium
- RU
- CB
- SI lab
- library
- cheese

### If you choose the grass:

The Djamba man offers you a maryjuana 

- accepts? (y / n)
- if you accept -> game over by excess of serothonim
- if you refuse -> bossfight (because he doesn't want to smoke alone)

### If you choose the gymnasium:

You ask the athlete where is Isa (she said whe would appear at the DASI voleyball training in the telegram group). He gets jealous and starts a fight.

### If you choose the RU:

You and the vegan guy are next to each other at the RU line. You, as aways, chooses the non-vegan option as aways, he makes a provocation and you two start fighting.

Each juice either gives you a buff or a debuff, so you have to choose the best juice (uva grape)

### If you choose the CB:

The Panelas promoter tries to sell you a Panelas ticket, you try to refuse but realizes you need to go there saturday to defeat him at a great fashion.

You need to do minigames to gather money to afford the ticket.

### If you choose the SI lab:

You encounter the SI nerd having a hard time solving a C bug, he asks you for help, if you solve it first try he is insta-killed, but if you don't, the bossfight starts

### If you choose the library:

Luiz Hamilton Guidorizzi is there, standing menancingly as he solves 60 calculations per second. You get scared, and try to run away, but he calculates your route and expands his domain (Um curso de c√°lculo vol. 1). Bossfight starts.

### If you choose the cheese:

Oda is transcending at the cheese, levitating, having the time of his life, reaching nirvana, finding the real life One Piece, if you may. You get closer, and as his aura starts to burn your face he notices your presence, which disturbs him from his "queijo moment". Get ready to die.
