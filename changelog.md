## Lore

You wake up as an SI student in the first week of classes and you have a crush on an e-girl classmate (Isa) that you met in the university's introduction week. She has 7 ex-boyfriends that are obsessed with her. You need to fight them to get closer to her.

You are entering EACH at the CPTM gate, the guard asks you for your cusp (USP card), so you have to play a minigame to give it to him.

You run to your class at Titanic and plays the Calculo 1 class minigame (if you lose the minigame Isa gets disapointed and if you win she starts to notice you)
